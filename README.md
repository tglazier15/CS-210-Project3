# CS-210-Project3


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This is a grocery tracking program that will allow the company to track what items are purchased in a given day. Show a number representing how many times a specific item was     purchjased in a given day. Then also produce a text-based histogram listing all the items purchased.

What did you do particularly well?
  I think that I did a good job connecting up C++ and python together to make it all function correctly.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Making the interface look better and more user friendly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Connecting python to C++ was very difficult but using Google and watching some YouTube tutorials I was able to get it functional.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  If I ever have a need to connect C++ and python again I can come back to this file and see how it was done.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added tons of comments to make sure that I can go back and see what was done and why it was done.
